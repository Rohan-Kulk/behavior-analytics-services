As a cluster administrator, you can deploy cluster logging to aggregate all the logs from your OpenShift Container Platform cluster, such as node system logs, application container logs, and so forth.

As a cluster administrators, you can deploy cluster logging using a few CLI commands and install Elasticsearch Operator and Cluster Logging Operator. When the operators are installed, create a Cluster Logging Custom Resource (CR) to schedule cluster logging pods and other resources necessary to support cluster logging. The operators are responsible for deploying, upgrading, and maintaining cluster logging.

Administrators and application developers can view the logs of the projects for which they have view access.

#### Cluster logging components
There are currently 4 different types of cluster logging components:

-   Elasticsearch /LogStore- This is where the logs will be stored. 
    
-   Fluentd /Collection- This is the component that collects logs from the node, formats them, and stores them in the logStore. 

-   Kibana /Visualization- This is the UI component used to view logs, graphs, charts, and so forth. 
    
-   Curator/Curation- This is the component that trims logs by age.
