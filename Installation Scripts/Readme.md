### **Note:** Refer below steps to install BAS 1.1 only on NON-PRODUCTION setup

***Pre-requistes:***

Below tools should be installed on your terminal before you start script execution:

1. OC
2. jq

**Steps:**

1. Download scripts in your current directory from
   <https://github.com/rhm-samples/behavior-analytics-services/tree/bas-11-support/Installation%20Scripts>

2. The cr.properties has the variables to create the deployment. Update the cr.properties file

   ```execute
   vi cr.properties
   ```

    Save the file ":wq"

3. Make scripts executable.

    ```
     chmod +x BAS_installation.sh bas-script-functions.bash 
    ```

4. Login to your Openshift from terminal.

   Copy the oc login command

   Paste it on the terminal.

   ```bash
   oc login --token=<token> --server=<Openshift cluster>
   ```

5. Create a CatalogSource using CLI:

    ```
    cat <<EOF>catalogsource.yaml
    apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
    kind: CatalogSource
    metadata:
      name: bas-11-source
      namespace: openshift-marketplace
    spec:
      sourceType: grpc
      image: quay.io/growthstack/bas-operator:bas-index-1.1.0-private
      displayName: BAS-1.1.0
      publisher: Red Hat Partner
      updateStrategy:
        registryPoll:
          interval: 5m
    EOF
    ```

    Execute this command.

    ```
    oc create -f catalogsource.yaml 
    ```

#### Note - Wait for 5 minutes and ensure that the operator Behavior Analytics Services is availabe in OperatorHub before executing below steps

6. Execute the script BAS_installation.sh

   ```execute
   ./BAS_installation.sh
   ```

   It takes approximately 35 mins for the deployment to complete

7. On successful completion, the script will print the **API KEY**, **BAS Endpoint URL** and **Grafana URL** on the console.

8. Additionally a log file "bas-installation.log" is generated for debug purpose.
